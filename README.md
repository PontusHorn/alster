# Alster

NOTE: This project is still in early development and the current app is not representative of my intentions for it.

A low-code generative art tool that aims to lower the technical and mathematical barrier to generative art and encourage creative expression.

## Developing

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

## Deploying

This part is still to be determined.
