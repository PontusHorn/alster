        This is the "Light/Info Square" icon from the Iconly set by https://piqo.design/.
        It has been modified slightly to fit the needs of this project, by using "currentColor" as
        the stroke color, removing some unnecessary code, restructuring, and moving the content down
        by 1px to align better.
